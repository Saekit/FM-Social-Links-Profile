## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use Styled Components in React. I decided to store the styled components in their own files to keep the jsx file clean.

### Continued development

I want to continue to use styled components on future React projects. I like how easy it is to assign css to components and use those components where needed.

### Useful resources

- [Styled Components Docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#) - This helped me get started with styled components.
- [Styled Components: To Use or Not to Use?](https://medium.com/building-crowdriff/styled-components-to-use-or-not-to-use-a6bb4a7ffc21) - This is a good artcle outlining the pros and cons of styled components.
